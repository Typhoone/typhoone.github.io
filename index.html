      <p class="text-center">
        I am a person who enjoys knowledge which has lead me to experiment with a wide variety of technology from hardware to software. The idea of pushing something to its limits and further has always intrigued me which is probably why I went into an Engineering degree.
        <br>
        Some of the things I have tinkered with is installing a custom operating system on my router to enable openVPN for selected connected devices. I have also tinkered with custom operating systems on devices such as Smart phones, Nintendo 3DS, and PlayStation sometimes multiple on the same devices at one time to gain added functionality to the device in use.
        <br>
        Going for an Engineering degree was not just because I enjoy tearing down bits of technology but it also satisfied my thirst for knowledge, having access to tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, knowledge resources in the form of professors, and Arthur's workshop.
        <br>
        One of the opportunities made available to me through University is Microsoft Student Accelerator which ultimately gave me an internship at Datacom where I was able to work with a great team and lean an amazing JavaScript library for making dashboards which you can see at the examples page
